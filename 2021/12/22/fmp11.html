<p>It’s that time of year again! FRESHMusicPlayer 11 is out! Here’s some of the highlights.</p>

<h2 id="fullscreen-mode">Fullscreen Mode</h2>
<p>There’s a new fullscreen 10 foot mode, for those times when you want to use FMP to play music for a party or just take in your music. Just hit F11!<br />
It shows lyrics, too!<br />

There’s also an option to black out the background, if that makes it easier to focus on what you’re doing.</p>
<h2 id="visual-improvements">Visual Improvements</h2>
<p>You might’ve noticed that lyrics now display the lines before and after the current line. We also gave the entire UI a fresh coat of paint, subtly updated
some UI elements to make things a bit more consistent, and smoothed out lots of animations.<br />

<h2 id="panes-as-separate-windows">Panes as Separate Windows</h2>
<p>You can now take better advantage of multiple monitors by opening panes as separate windows by shift clicking!<br />

You can have as many open as you’d like, so go wild!</p>

<h2 id="now-playing-cover-art">Now Playing Cover Art</h2>
<p>Cover art now shows in Windows’s Now Playing views!   <br />

<h2 id="other-things">Other things</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Lots of performance improvements across the board, especially with queue management and file loading - FMP no longer goes unresponsive while files are loading!</li>
  <li>Tracks with multiple artists will now be displayed properly while playing! Proper support in the library is planned to be added in FMP 12.</li>
  <li>Better support for non-file metadata - for example, if you use the CD plugin, you’ll be able to see the artist/title properly.</li>
  <li>New portable mode! Helpful for when you want to put FMP on a flash drive, or when you want to have multiple, completely separate installations of FMP on your machine.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="thats-all">That’s all!</h2>
