                FRESHMusicPlayer is a desktop music player designed to be simple and fast. It's designed to handle
                very large libraries up to 10,000 tracks or more well and has a comprehensive feature set.

            <p class="mt-[10px] mb-[10px]">
                FRESHMusicPlayer is a project that represents a lot of firsts for me. Originally started as a joke,
                FRESHMusicPlayer is the first GUI app I have ever made. At the time I first started working on it, I was very new to
                programming and barely knew what I was doing. However, by working on FMP, I learned a lot of the fundamentals of
                software development and UI design, as well as many of the technologies I use today, such as C#, .NET as a whole,
                WinForms, WPF, and Avalonia.

            <p class="mt-[10px]">Currently in development, Kotomi is a manga reader app.</p>
            <p class="mt-[10px]">
                I started Kotomi primarily to test out the viability of several things I'm planning to do with
                the FRESHMusicPlayer rewrite. It is fully cross platform and, for the first time for me, is designed to run on
                mobile. Unlike FRESHMusicPlayer, it is also built with a proper MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, and makes
                extensive use of bindings to keep the UI state up to date.
                It is planned to have a comprehensive extension system to allow for the addition of new features and support
                for additional book sources.

            <h2 class="h2 mt-[20px]">This Website</h2>
            <p>2021 - present</p>
            <p>Technologies used: <span class="font-bold">Tailwind CSS, Jekyll</span>, HTML/CSS/JS</p>
            <p class="mt-[10px]">
                This website is made in pure HTML/CSS/JS. It was recently rewritten to use Tailwind CSS, which I have found very enjoyable to use.

            <h2 class="h2 mt-[20px]">Additional Projects</h2>
            <p>These projects aren't as fleshed out or notable as the ones on top, but I figured they might still be interesting.</p>

            <p class="mt-[10px]"><span class="font-bold">squish</span> (2022) - squish is a Linux desktop environment built in .NET and Avalonia. I never got around
            to finishing it, but it got to the point where it actually launched and started to properly integrate with the system as a desktop environment. To my
            knowledge, this is the first such project to actually be made.</p>

             <p class="mt-[10px] mb-[10px]"><span class="font-bold">ShrimpBot</span> (2017 - present) - ShrimpBot is a Discord bot. It has a basic economy system and a few "fun"
            commands to play around with. Although it isn't actively maintained anymore, it's still up and running and will be until the old Discord API version it uses
            stops working. ShrimpBot has a special place in my heart as the very first proper app I ever programmed.</p>
