It's that time of year again! FRESHMusicPlayer 11 is out! Here's some of the highlights.

## Fullscreen Mode
There's a new fullscreen 10 foot mode, for those times when you want to use FMP to play music for a party or just take in your music. Just hit F11!  
It shows lyrics, too!

There's also an option to black out the background, if that makes it easier to focus on what you're doing.  
## Visual Improvements
You might've noticed that lyrics now display the lines before and after the current line. We also gave the entire UI a fresh coat of paint, subtly updated
some UI elements to make things a bit more consistent, and smoothed out lots of animations.

## Panes as Separate Windows
You can now take better advantage of multiple monitors by opening panes as separate windows by shift clicking!

You can have as many open as you'd like, so go wild!

## Now Playing Cover Art
Cover art now shows in Windows's Now Playing views!

## Other things
- Lots of performance improvements across the board, especially with queue management and file loading - FMP no longer goes unresponsive while files are loading!
- Tracks with multiple artists will now be displayed properly while playing! Proper support in the library is planned to be added in FMP 12.
- Better support for non-file metadata - for example, if you use the CD plugin, you'll be able to see the artist/title properly.
- New portable mode! Helpful for when you want to put FMP on a flash drive, or when you want to have multiple, completely separate installations of FMP on your machine.

## That's all!
