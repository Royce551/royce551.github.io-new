FRESHMusicPlayer 10 is out! This update comes with lots of quality of life improvements to keep your music playing experience as fresh as ever.  
> Actually, this update has been out for a while, I'm just making this to test the new blogging systems!  

Here are some of the highlights:

## New Mini Player
The new Mini Player fits snugly into your taskbar, staying out of your way.

When you hover over it, it becomes opaque and reveals more controls.

One neat feature is that, if you move the player to the top half of your window, the controls move to the top half. This allows you to tuck it into the
top of your screen, if that's what you prefer.

## Support for multiple artists in FLACs
In the past, FRESHMusicPlayer would only display the last artist for FLACs (MP3s didn't have this problem). Thanks to the developers of the metadata library I use, now you can see and edit multiple
artists! Even better support for multiple artists in the Library will come in a later release.

## Large cover art view
You can now hover over the cover art in the controls box to enlarge it. In the past, you had to open Track Info to do this.

## Player improvements
Your original, unshuffled queue is now preserved whenever you shuffle, plus, you can now Repeat All. In addition, the Previous button now acts like
most other music players: skips to the beginning of the track, and skips to the previous track if at the beginning.

## Auto Import
One common feature request is the ability to import folders. You could already import folders, but you would have to import again if you added new tracks to a
folder. Now, you can select folders to import from, and FRESHMusicPlayer will scan them on startup for new tracks to add.

## Windows 7 support
Since FRESHMusicPlayer 8, there has been a critical bug preventing Windows 7 users from using FRESHMusicPlayer. This bug has been fixed, so everything should work
as expected now!

## That's all!
There's lots more improvements and fixes that haven't been covered in this post. View the full change log and download the latest version
