    <h1 class="h1">Privacy</h1>
    <p>Your privacy is super important to us. If you have any complaints or concerns, please email us <a href="mailto:poohwie2005@gmail.com" class="text-blue underline">here</a>.
    All of our apps are open source, and you're welcome to look at all of our <a href="https://github.com/royce551" class="text-blue underline">code</a> if you'd like.</p>
    <p class="mt-[20px]">Data transmission and storage is handled as follows:</p>

    <h2 class="h2 mt-[10px]">FRESHMusicPlayer</h2>
    <p>- The installer version of FMP will contact <a href="https://github.com" class="text-blue underline">GitHub</a> on startup to check for and download updates by default.
    You can disable this by setting the auto update mode to manual.</p>
    <p>- Using Internet integrations like Discord Rich Presence, last.fm, MusicBrainz, and Discogs will transmit relevant information to these services.</p>
    <p>- If you have playtime logging enabled, FMP will locally log the tracks you listen to and when you have listened to them. This happens on device and is never sent.</p>

    <h2 class="h2 mt-[10px]">ShrimpBot</h2>
    <p>If you interact with ShrimpBot, it will store your publicly available Discord user ID so that it can remember you in the future. Your username may also be displayed
    in, for example, leaderboards.</p>
    <p>ShrimpBot also logs when and where commands are executed for analytics purposes. No message content is stored, and the log is cleared every time ShrimpBot restarts
    (typically 1-2 months). This log is only viewable by bot administrators.</p>
    <p class="mt-[10px]">ShrimpBot's server is located in Quebec, Canada.</p>
