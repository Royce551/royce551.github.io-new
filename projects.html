        <p class="mt-[10px]">FRESHMusicPlayer is a desktop music player designed to be simple and fast. It's designed to handle
        very large libraries up to 10,000 tracks or more well and has a comprehensive feature set.</p>
        <p class="mt-[10px] mb-[10px]">FRESHMusicPlayer is a project that represents a lot of firsts for me. Originally started as a joke,
        FRESHMusicPlayer is the first GUI app I have ever made. At the time I first started working on it, I was very new to
        programming and barely knew what I was doing. However, by working on FMP, I learned a lot of the fundamentals of
        software development and UI design, as well as many of the technologies I use today, such as C#, .NET as a whole,
        WinForms, WPF, and Avalonia.</p>

        <p class="mt-[10px]">Currently in development, Kotomi is a manga reader app.</p>
        <p class="mt-[10px]">I started Kotomi primarily to test out the viability of several things I'm planning to do with
        the FRESHMusicPlayer rewrite. It is fully cross platform and, for the first time for me, is designed to run on
        mobile. Unlike FRESHMusicPlayer, it is also built with a proper MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, and makes
        extensive use of bindings to keep the UI state up to date.
        It is planned to have a comprehensive extension system to allow for the addition of new features and support
        for additional book sources.</p>
