<h1 class="h1">Settings</h1>
<p>These are all of the settings that FRESHMusicPlayer has, in the order they are shown.</p>

<h2 class="h2 mt-[10px]">General</h2>
<h3 class="h3 mt-[10px]">Language</h3>
<p>Set your language, or set to Automatic to use your system language, if available</p>
<h3 class="h3 mt-[10px]">Auto Queue</h3>
<p>If enabled, when you play a track from the artists, albums, or playlists tab, the rest of the tracks in that collection will all be enqueued as well, similar
    to how most streaming services work. This allows you to use the skip back and skip forward buttons to skip through the collection. However, the auto queue will
    be overidden when you start enqueuing tracks manually.</p>
<h3 class="h3 mt-[10px]">Auto Import</h3>
<p>Set the folders here that you want FMP to automatically import. FMP will continuously scan for new audio files added to these folders, even if you add files while
    FMP is actively running, and import them into your library.</p>
<h3 class="h3 mt-[10px]">Integrations</h3>
<p>- Discord Rich Presence: Integrates FMP with Discord Rich Presence. FMP will also attempt to locate the album on MusicBrainz and use that to show the playing track's
    cover art in your presence, however, this may be wrong. If the track has a MusicBrainz ID embedded, it will always use that instead, getting more reliable results.</p>
<p>- System Transport Controls: Integrates FMP with your system. This allows you to see playing track information in various places around your system and also enables
    you to use your media keys system-wide.</p>
<p>- last.fm: Integrates FMP with last.fm. Check the box, then follow the prompts to log in to last.fm. You can log out afterward by unchecking the box. FMP will both send
    scrobbles and update your current now playing song.</p>
<h3 class="h3 mt-[10px]">Updates</h3>
<p>If you are using the installer version of FMP, you can manage updates here. Auto update modes are as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>- Manual: FMP will not check for updates on startup, you will have to use the button in settings</li>
    <li>- Automatic: FMP will check for and install updates on startup, and then will restart automatically once installed.</li>
    <li>- Prompt before updating: FMP will check for and install updates on startup, but will send you a notification prompting you to restart once the update is installed.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="h2 mt-[10px]">Playback</h2>
<h3 class="h3 mt-[10px]">ReplayGain</h3>
<p>Enable ReplayGain to use the ReplayGain information embedded in your audio files to normalize the percieved loudness of all of the songs you listen to. You can set
    whether you prefer to use the track or the album adjustment values (if one isn't available, then the other will be used), and set a pre-amp for files with
    ReplayGain information. Note that even if you set the value above 0, FMP will not allow the audio to peak (according to the embedded peak information), which might
    reduce dynamics.</p>
<h3 class="h3 mt-[10px]">Equalizer</h3>
<p>Use the sliders to set your preferred EQ -- you can use the buttons on top to use a prefix. Note that if you are using backend plugins, EQ will only apply if the
    track you're listening to uses a backend that supports EQ.</p>

<h2 class="h2 mt-[10px]">Apperance</h2>
<p>- Show time instead of title in window title: If enabled, the initial part of the window's name will show playback progress instead of the name of the current song.
    This is useful if you have taskbar labels enabled in Windows.</p>
<p>- Show track progress in taskbar: If enabled, the track progress will be displayed as task progress in the taskbar. This has the best results on Windows 11. Keep in
    mind that this may interfere with screen readers.</p>
<h3 class="h3 mt-[10px]">Theme</h3>
<p>Set your preferred color theme</p>
<h3 class="h3 mt-[10px]">Accent color</h3>
<p>Set your preferred accent color. If set to "match cover art", the accent color will be the most prevalent colors in the currently playing track's cover art.</p>

<h2 class="h2 mt-[10px]">Maintenance</h2>
<p>Reset settings to default: Does what it says on the tin.</p>
<p>Clean and update library: This removes duplicate track entries from the library, then triggers a metadata rescan on your entire library. Use this if you have
    changed the metadata of a lot of the tracks on your library.</p>
<p>Nuke library: Clears your entire library</p>
